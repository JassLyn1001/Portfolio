Hi there, my name is Jassica Listyarini.

I'm a young, passionate, and dedicated climate data sciences enthusiast with 5+ years of experience in data analysis for climate science. Though most of my experiences revolve around developing statistical models for downscaling/bias correction method, I also strive to gain more knowledge about the wide use of machine learning for climate-related research and projects to expand my skill set in becoming a successful climate data scientist. Currently, I am working with big data from CMIP6 simulation using ANN model for bias-correction purposes to investigate the impact of climate change on solar energy potential in Indonesia.

## My Projects
--------------

[Chord Diagram with Circlize in R](https://github.com/JassLyn1001/Chord-Diagram-with-Circlize-in-R.git).

Created data visualization to illustrate the university (IPB University) contributin for Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) in various activities, including learning activities, student activities, research and innovations, community services, and campus operations. 

--------------

[Statisitical Dowscaling using bias-correction approach for long-term precipitation extremes analysis](https://github.com/JassLyn1001/MMEDownscaling.git)

Developed a statistical model to correct bias from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data output to perform high resolutin of climate information. 

--------------

[Climate Change Analysis using Rainfall Dataset with Python](https://github.com/JassLyn1001/ColabGuidelines_Climate-Change-Analysis-Using-Rainfall-Dataset-with-Python.git)

Created a Google Colab guideline for climate data analysis using the Regional Climate Model over Indonesia
