Hi there, my name is Jassica Listyarini.

I am a young passionate and dedicated data science enthusiast with almost three years of experience in data analysis for climate science. Though most of my experiences revolves around developing statistical models and data visualization in the climate field, I also strive to gain more knowledge about the wide use of data science including data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning and data storytelling so that I can expand my skillset and build new and amazing things.

## My Projects
--------------

[Chord Diagram with Circlize in R](https://github.com/JassLyn1001/Chord-Diagram-with-Circlize-in-R.git).

Created data visualization to illustrate the university (IPB University) contributin for Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) in various activities, including learning activities, student activities, research and innovations, community services, and campus operations. 

--------------

[Statisitical Dowscaling using bias-correction approach for long-term precipitation extremes analysis](https://github.com/JassLyn1001/MMEDownscaling.git)

Developed a statistical model to correct bias from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data output to perform high resolutin of climate information. 

--------------

[Climate Change Analysis using Rainfall Dataset with Python](https://github.com/JassLyn1001/ColabGuidelines_Climate-Change-Analysis-Using-Rainfall-Dataset-with-Python.git)

Creating a Google Colab guideline for climate data analysis using Python
